        <strong style="color: #0d47a1; font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</strong> Since the inception of learning analytics, the CSCL community has been applying a range of methods to examine collaborative discourse, such as natural language processing and networked approaches. Despite significant advancements in methods, a critical gap persists in translating these data-driven insights into actionable strategies to inform pedagogical decisions. The proposed hybrid symposium seeks to bridge this gap by engaging learning scientists, CSCL researchers, and educators in discussions that integrate advanced discourse analytics with pedagogical design. Through five diverse presentations, the symposium will explore the integration of advanced discourse analysis techniques, such as networked approaches, multimodal analytics, and clustering analysis, into pedagogically meaningful designs and actionable pedagogical insights for collaborative learning environments. By fostering dialogue on the challenges and opportunities in contextualizing computational insights, this symposium aims to establish actionable approaches for enriching collaborative discourse and advancing the broader CSCL community’s theoretical, methodological, and practical understanding.

<h4>Introduction</h4>
   <p>
Collaborative discourse plays a central role in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) by facilitating critical thinking, problem-solving, and constructive dialogue. Defined broadly collaborative discourse involves interaction among individuals engaging in the collective process of knowledge creation, where each contributes to and takes responsibility for advancing shared knowledge (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2014). This process encompasses a variety of interactional dynamics at both individual and group levels, from generating and exchanging ideas, to challenging others’ perspectives and collaboratively refining concepts together (Cress & Kimmerle, 2018). Through these exchanges, discourse fosters not only individual cognitive growth but also the development of essential higher-order skills such as critical thinking, effective communication, and collaboration, which are vital in educational contexts and beyond (Baker & Lund, 1997; Noroozi et al., 2018). Recently, the rapid application of generative artificial intelligence, such as conversational agents, introduces both opportunities and complexities in supporting and analyzing collaborative discourse. While AI-driven tools offer potential for dynamic, real-time discourse that can adapt to individual learners’ contributions and scaffoldings, they also demand careful consideration to ensure these technologies foster rich, group-oriented learning experiences rather than isolated interactions.<br>   </p>
   <p>
Over the past decades, advancements in technology have introduced innovative methods for automated discourse analysis, leveraging techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and network science. These computational approaches allow for a more granular and nuanced understanding of discourse, capturing the intricate ways in which students build knowledge collaboratively (Cress & Kimmerle, 2018). As an analytical lens, several frameworks have been proposed to facilitate in-depth examination of discourse, including Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis (CMDA; Herring, 2004) and the Joint Attention–Interaction–Creation (AIC) Framework (Zhu & Chen, 2023). For example, Zhu and Chen (2023) proposed the AIC framework, which uses NLP and socio-semantic network analysis (SSNA) to capture the contextual dynamics of discourse through the networked lens. Beyond analytical advancement, practical computational tools have been developed to support discourse analysis at scale, such as the Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) tool (Shaffer & Ruis, 2017) and the Knowledge Building Discourse Explorer (KBDeX) (Oshima et al., 2012). For instance, Oshima et al. (2012) developed the KBdeX tool, enabling researchers to visualize and analyze how learners’ ideas evolve within a collaborative networked environment. These tools have empowered educators and researchers with robust means of capturing, examining, and visualizing discourse patterns, offering significant potential to inform the design of collaborative discourse activities. <br>
</p>
   <p>
Despite these significant advancements in the field, discourse analysis often remains disconnected from pedagogical practices. A notable barrier lies in contextualizing sophisticated analytical findings in ways that directly enhance student engagement in authentic CSCL environments. Several studies have made progress in this intersecting area. For example, Chen, Chang, Ouyang, and Zhou (2018) investigated how a student-facing analytics tool could be adapted and implemented for classroom use to visualize patterns of posting and replying in asynchronous discussions, helping students understand and improve their social engagement. Similarly, Li, Jung, Wise, Sommer, and Axelrod (2021) implemented a student-facing analytic report that displayed metrics indicating quality metrics for meaningful team collaboration in online graduate discussions. While these efforts have demonstrated the potential of automated discourse analysis to inform the design of discourse-rich learning activities, more work is needed to address the actionability of analytical advances in discourse analysis. Particularly, as we continue unveiling the complexity and dynamics of collaborative discourse, it is equally critical to consider how these nuanced insights can drive practical implementations. <br>
</p>
   <p>
This symposium seeks to bridge the gap between computational analysis and practical implementation by exploring how nuanced discourse analysis can be contextualized to inform the design and enactment of pedagogically meaningful collaborative learning experiences. Our goals are threefold: (1) to investigate practical applications of advanced discourse analysis methods within educational contexts; (2) to identify challenges and opportunities in translating computational insights into actionable strategies for educators; and (3) to foster dialogue on future directions for integrating discourse analysis into CSCL environments to support meaningful learner engagement in knowledge construction. <br>  </p>
   <p>
To achieve these goals, this symposium brings together five presentations from scholars across diverse institutions who have been actively exploring the applications of computational discourse analysis in learning contexts. Each presentation offers a unique lens for contextualizing discourse analytics in CSCL practices. These include: uncovering the multi-layered dynamics of idea advancement in knowledge building (Oshima & Oshima); capturing the socio-cognitive and temporal patterns of student participation in social annotation activities (Zhu, Chen, & Jung); analyzing the structural and temporal dimensions of knowledge construction in gamified asynchronous discussions (Moon, McNeill, Edmonds, Banihashem, & Noroozi); leveraging multimodal nonverbal analytics to investigate small group interactions (Dey & Puntambekar); and examining how students interact with generative AI over time in knowledge construction discourse (Jung & Jackson). Key questions that each presentation will respond include:
<ol>
    <li>What kinds of computational analysis methods can be effectively translated into pedagogically meaningful designs that foster collaborative learning in practice? How?</li>
    <li>What are the current challenges and opportunities in applying advanced discourse analytics to the design of collaborative learning activities?</li>
    <li>In what ways can existing CSCL theories inform the integration of computational discourse analysis into technology-enhanced learning activities?</li>
    <li>What approaches or principles can be developed to guide future research and design efforts that aim to foster more meaningful collaborative discourse using computational analysis?</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>

Through the five interconnected presentations, followed by a moderated discussion led by the discussant, this symposium aims to contribute to the CSCL community by advancing both methodological approaches and practical implementation that enhance collaborative discourse learning experiences. Participants are invited to engage in reflective discussions, aimed at developing actionable approaches for integrating computational discourse analysis into learning design. Through this dialogue, this symposium aims to strengthen connections between theory, methods, and practice, laying the groundwork for future research that connects computational analysis with pedagogical designs to create impactful collaborative discourses in technology-enhanced settings.
