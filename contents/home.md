### üå∫ Call for Participation

Dear Annotators,

We are excited to invite you to contribute to an interdisciplinary symposium on social annotation at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) in Buffalo, NY this June. This symposium aims to explore relevant theories and practical strategies for fostering social annotation in the classroom.

Social annotation is more than asking students to read together. To go beyond current practices, we are excited to invite you to be part of this initiative by participating in our own social annotation activity ‚Äì even if you‚Äôre not attending the conference. By joining our discussion, you‚Äôll help us expand our collective understanding of social annotation and improve practices as a community.

#### Here are two ways to get involved ‚§µ: 

Annotate the symposium paper: We invite you to annotate our symposium paper via Hypothesis before the conference (June 10), available at: ‚≠êüîó https://osf.io/preprints/osf/zrb3y üîó‚≠ê.  

It showcases five projects led by researchers from multiple institutions, each exploring social annotation from unique perspectives. Feel free to check out the annotations made by the   presenters and other participants, annotate, and build knowledge together.  In your annotations, we are particularly interested in learning about:

- Who you are; 

How specific learning theories, technologies, or applications are relevant to you;

How AI, including Generative AI, could potentially be connected to these areas.

Join the conference discussion (optional): The symposium will be held at the ISLS conference both in person and virtually. You are invited to join the discussion if you plan to attend the conference (a registration fee may apply; details will be shared later).

Insights from the annotations will incorporated into the symposium at the conference. 

This symposium marks our first initiative to bring together diverse perspectives to advance research and practices in social annotation, and we hope to plan future events to continue our conversations. Stay tuned! üéâ
