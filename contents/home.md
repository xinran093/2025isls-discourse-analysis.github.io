### Towards Actionable Collaborative Discourse Analysis: Bridging Advanced Computational Analysis with Practical Implementation | ISLS 25

### Call for Participation

We are excited to invite you to contribute to an interdisciplinary symposium on <span style="color: #0d47a1;">**actionable discourse analysis**</span> at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) in Helsinki, Finland this June. This symposium aims to establish actionable approaches for integrating computational discourse analytics into pedagogical design to enrich collaborative learning and inform CSCL research and practice.

This symposium will be a collaborative discourse activityâ€”and the discourse starts before the symposium! Join our <span style="color: #0d47a1;">**pre-conference social annotation**</span> activity, even if youâ€™re not attending the conference. By participating, youâ€™ll help spark collective insights into how discourse analysis methods translate into real-world practice, how CSCL theories support their integration, and what challenges and design principles can guide the path forward.


#### Here are two ways to get involved â¤µ: 

1. <span style="color: #0d47a1;">Annotate the Symposium Paper</span>
We invite you to annotate our symposium paper below using a social annotation tool called Hypothesis before the conference (by June 8). To get started, install the Hypothesis browser plugin and scroll down to the paper on this page. See the tutorial section below for step-by-step instructions.

It showcases 5 projects led by researchers from multiple institutions, each exploringthe integration of different discourse analysis techniques, such as networked approaches, multimodal analytics, and clustering analysis, into pedagogically meaningful designs for collaborative learning environments. 

In your annotations, we are particularly interested in learning about:

2. <span class="text-red">**Join the conference discussion (optional)**</span>: The symposium will take place at the ISLS Conference, both in person and online. If youâ€™re attending, we warmly welcome you to join the discussion. Details will be shared with all participants who contribute annotations.

Insights from the annotations will incorporated into the symposium at the conference. 

This symposium marks our first initiative to bring together diverse perspectives to advance research and practices in social annotation, and we hope to plan future events to continue our conversations. Stay tuned! ðŸŽ‰
