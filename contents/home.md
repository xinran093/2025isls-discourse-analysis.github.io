### Towards Actionable Collaborative Discourse Analysis: Bridging Advanced Computational Analysis with Practical Implementation | ISLS 25

### Call for Participation

We are excited to invite you to contribute to an interdisciplinary symposium on <span class="text-red">**actionable discourse analysis**</span> at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) in Helsinki, Finland this June. This symposium aims to establish actionable approaches for integrating computational discourse analytics into pedagogical design to enrich collaborative learning and inform CSCL research and practice.

This symposium will be a collaborative discourse activity‚Äîand the discourse starts before the symposium! Join our <span class="text-red">**pre-conference social annotation**</span> activity, even if you‚Äôre not attending the conference. By participating, you‚Äôll help spark collective insights into how discourse analysis methods translate into real-world practice, how CSCL theories support their integration, and what challenges and design principles can guide the path forward.


#### Here are two ways to get involved ‚§µ: 

1. <span class="text-red"> **Annotate the symposium paper**</span>: We invite you to annotate our symposium paper via Hypothesis before the conference (June 8), available at: ‚≠êüîó https://osf.io/preprints/osf/zrb3y üîó‚≠ê.  

It showcases six projects led by researchers from multiple institutions, each exploringthe integration of different discourse analysis techniques, such as networked approaches, multimodal analytics, and clustering analysis, into pedagogically meaningful designs for collaborative learning environments. 

In your annotations, we are particularly interested in learning about:




2. <span class="text-red">**Join the conference discussion (optional)**</span>: The symposium will be held at the ISLS conference both in person and virtually. You are invited to join the discussion if you plan to attend the conference (a registration fee may apply; details will be shared later).

Insights from the annotations will incorporated into the symposium at the conference. 

This symposium marks our first initiative to bring together diverse perspectives to advance research and practices in social annotation, and we hope to plan future events to continue our conversations. Stay tuned! üéâ
