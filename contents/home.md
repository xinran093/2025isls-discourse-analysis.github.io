### Towards Actionable Collaborative Discourse Analysis: Bridging Advanced Computational Analysis with Practical Implementation <br>ISLS 25


<div class="call-for-participation" style="text-align: justify;">

### Call for Participation
<p style="font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 1.4;">
We are excited to invite you to contribute to an interdisciplinary symposium on <strong style="color:rgb(146, 41, 2); font-weight: bold;">actionable discourse analysis</strong> at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) in Helsinki, Finland this June. This symposium aims to establish actionable approaches for integrating computational discourse analytics into pedagogical design to enrich collaborative learning and inform CSCL research and practice. </p>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 1.4;">We see this symposium as a collaborative discourse experience that doesn’t just happen in Helsinki during the conference—it starts now, with everyone interested in this topic. As part of our <strong style="color:rgb(146, 41, 2); font-weight: bold;">pre-conference activities</strong>, we invite you to read and comment on our symposium paper using <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/" target="_blank">Hypothesis</a>, a social annotation tool that lets you highlight and comment directly on the text. It’s a great way for us to kick off the conversation, share ideas, and build connections before the conference.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 1.4;">
You are invited to be a part of this even if you’re not attending the conference. By participating, you’ll help spark collective insights into how discourse analysis methods translate into real-world practice, how CSCL theories support their integration, and what challenges and design principles can guide the path forward.
</p>

<h5>Here are two ways to get involved ⤵:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.4;">
    <strong style="color:rgb(146, 41, 2);">Annotate the Symposium Paper</strong>: Annotate our symposium paper below using Hypothesis before the conference (by June 8). Here is a: <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/help/quick-start-guide/" target="_blank">3-step quick start guide for Hypothesis</a></p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.4;">The paper showcases five projects led by researchers from multiple institutions, each exploring the integration of different discourse analysis techniques—such as networked approaches, multimodal analytics, and clustering analysis—into pedagogically meaningful designs for collaborative learning environments.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.4;">In your annotations, we are particularly interested in learning about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1;">Who you are and what your background is?</li>
      <li style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1;">What ideas resonate most with you?</li>   
      <li style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1;">What questions or challenges come to mind?</li>
      <li style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1;">How might these approaches apply to your own context?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<li> 
<p style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.4;"><strong style="color:rgb(146, 41, 2); font-weight: bold;">Join the Conference Discussion (optional)</strong>: The symposium will take place at the ISLS Conference, both in person and online. If you’re attending, we warmly welcome you to join the discussion. Details will be shared with all participants who contribute annotations.</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.4;">
<strong>Session Time:</strong><br>
  Tuesday, June 10, 2025<br>
  16:30–18:00 EEST (Helsinki)<br>
 08:30–10:00 CT (Chicago)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<br>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 1.4;">
Insights from the annotations will incorporated into the symposium at the conference. </p>
